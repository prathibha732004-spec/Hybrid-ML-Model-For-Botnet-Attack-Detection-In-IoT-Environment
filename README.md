# Hybrid Machine Learning Model For Efficient Botnet Attack Detection In IoT Environment

This project implements a hybrid machine learning model designed to detect botnet attacks within Internet of Things (IoT) environments efficiently.

## Project Structure

- **BACKEND**: Contains the backend logic and model handling.
- **FRONTEND**: Contains the user interface and application logic (e.g., `app.py`).
- **Models**: Includes pre-trained models such as Random Forest for detection.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Detection**: Uses a hybrid ML approach to identify threats.
- **IoT Optimization**: Tailored for the constraints and nature of IoT network traffic.
- **User Interface**: Provides a frontend for interaction and visualization.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the `FRONTEND` or `BACKEND` directory to experiment with the components.
2. Review the `app.py` in `FRONTEND` for the main application entry point.
